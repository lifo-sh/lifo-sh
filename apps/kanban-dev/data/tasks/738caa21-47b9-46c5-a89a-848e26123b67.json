Feedback: The task statement 'count how many words are there in word Apple' is ambiguous and was misinterpreted; The phrase should be read as 'how many words are in [the] word Apple', meaning analyzing the composition of the single word 'Apple'; Since 'Apple' is one word, the question likely asks for letter count (5 letters: A-p-p-l-e) or could be confirming it's 1 word; The implementation incorrectly treated 'word Apple' as a two-word phrase to analyze; Recommendation: Clarify the ambiguous requirement first, then implement counting letters in 'Apple' (answer: 5) or confirming 'Apple' is 1 word; The test results correctly identified this interpretation error",
